# Gosh!

Gosh stands for ***Go Shell***
It is still under development. It will be a small simple shell that is similar to my [Rust](https://github.com/mbc90/Rush)

### Builtin

The builtins I plan to add 

| bultin   | Status |
|----------|--------|
| cd       | :x:    |
| pwd      | :x:    |
| mkdir    | :x:    |
| mv       | :x:    |
| hostname | :x:    |

right now all this program does is take input and split the string.
So, pretty much nothing...
